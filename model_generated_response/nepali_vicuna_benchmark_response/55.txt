Instruction in English:  What would have happened if the Beatles never formed as a band? Your response must be less than 6 sentences.
                        Response in English: If the Beatles had never formed as a band, the world would have been deprived of one of the most influential musical groups of all time. The Beatles' impact on popular music, culture, and society would have been greatly diminished. Their music would not have inspired countless other musicians and bands, and their songs would not have become the timeless classics that they are today. The Beatles' legacy would not have been the same, and the world would have been a very different place.. 
                        Response in Nepali: यदि बीटल्सले ब्यान्डको रूपमा कहिल्यै गठन गरेको भएन भने, संसारलाई सबै समयको सबैभन्दा प्रभावशाली संगीत समूहहरू मध्ये एकबाट वञ्चित भएको थियो। लोकप्रिय संगीत, संस्कृति र समाजमा बीटल्सको प्रभाव धेरै कम भएको थियो। तिनीहरूको संगीतले अनगिन्ती अन्य संगीतकारहरू र ब्यान्डहरूलाई प्रेरित गरेको थिएन, र तिनीहरूका गीतहरू आज तिनीहरू हुने क्लासिक हुने थिएनन्। बीटल्सको विरासत उस्तै हुने थिएन, र संसार एकदमै फरक ठाउँ भएको थियो।
