                        Response in English: If the Maya civilization never mysteriously collapsed, it is likely that it would have continued to flourish and develop. The Maya were known for their advanced mathematics, astronomy, and architecture, and they had a sophisticated understanding of the natural world. If the civilization had not collapsed, it is possible that they would have continued to make advancements in these areas, and that their knowledge would have been passed down through the generations. Additionally, their art and culture would have continued to evolve, and they may have had a significant impact on the development of other civilizations in the region..
