Instruction in English:  What would happen if Christopher Columbus never discovered America? Your response must be less than 6 sentences..
                        Response in English: If Christopher Columbus had never discovered America, there would have been no European colonization of the Americas. This would have meant that the indigenous people of the Americas would have been able to develop their own cultures and societies without interference from Europeans. However, it is also possible that without the introduction of European diseases, the population of the Americas would have been much larger than it was at the time of Columbus's arrival.. 
                        Response in Nepali: यदि क्रिस्टोफर कोलम्बसले अमेरिका पत्ता नलागेको भए, त्यहाँ अमेरिकाको युरोपेली उपनिवेश हुने थिएन। यसको मतलब यो हुने थियो कि अमेरिकाका आदिवासी मानिसहरूले युरोपेलीहरूबाट हस्तक्षेप बिना आफ्नै संस्कृति र समाजको विकास गर्न सक्षम हुने थियो। यद्यपि, यो पनि सम्भव छ कि युरोपेली रोगहरूको परिचय बिना, कोलम्बसको आगमनको समयमा भन्दा धेरै ठूलो अमेरिकाको जनसंख्या हुने थियो।
